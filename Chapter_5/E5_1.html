  <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties.</p>
<p>My father recommends:</p>

<blockquote>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend.<br>
			Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it.<br>
			In the winter, try serving it warm."
</blockquote>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
<li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
<li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
<li>1 t. capers</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<h2><dt>Instructions</dt></h2>
<dd>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possi-ble.</dd>

<dd>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, but still retain some
texture.</dd>

<dd>Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).</dd>
</dl>
