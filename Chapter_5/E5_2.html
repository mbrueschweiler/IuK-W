<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <em>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</em>.<br>
To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
